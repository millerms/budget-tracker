House style: small modules, no god functions; Google/NumPy docstrings; type hints; config via .env; Paths not strings; reproducible logic.
Quality gates: ruff, black, pytest -q, pre-commit.
Docs: Every file added/changed gets a short “file card” in docs/file_index.md (Purpose, Inputs/Outputs, Key logic, Testing ideas).
Git: conventional commits; feature branches.
